Hi all- I thought some of you would be interested in attending our upcoming MongoDB developers class. This course is now available with Spanish subtitles. Help will also be available to students from Spanish speakers in the class discussion forum. M101P: MongoDB for Developers class starts on September 9th. Hope to see you there!
