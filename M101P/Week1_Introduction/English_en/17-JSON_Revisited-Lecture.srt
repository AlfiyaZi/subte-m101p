1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:00,460
All right.

3
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,170
Let's revisit JSON now and talk

4
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,430
about what it can represent.

5
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:05,570
And then we're going to get to
why it can represent it.

6
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:09,130
There are only two basic data
structures inside JSON, and

7
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,920
they are arrays and
dictionaries.

8
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,400
Now, we all know what
arrays are.

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,800
Arrays are list of things.

10
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,950
And dictionaries are these
associative maps.

11
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:20,830
So they can be combined
in arbitrary ways.

12
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:24,290
So an array inside JSON is
represented using these square

13
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,600
brackets and then a list
of items between.

14
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,010
And a dictionary is represented
using the curly

15
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,280
braces, and it's a bunch of
keyword and value pairs.

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,850
And then there's a keyword,
a colon, and then a value.

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:37,380
And there could be arbitrary
numbers of these

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,940
separated by commas.

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,460
Those are only two data
structures inside JSON.

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,350
And they're all just combined,
and they could be nested in

21
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,550
arbitrary ways.

22
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,910
So I can create a very
deep document.

23
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,560
So I can create a document, for
instance, and at the top

24
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,110
level, there has to
be a dictionary.

25
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,070
And I can create something with
a name and that has a

26
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:57,260
value, and then I could have a
city, and it can have another

27
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,660
value here.

28
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,900
And then I could put, for
instance, if this is just a

29
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,060
collection of people and their
cities and maybe their

30
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,990
interests, I can have another
key here called Interest, and

31
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,040
that could turn out
to be an array.

32
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,640
And it's got square brackets,
and I could

33
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,290
put things in here.

34
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,440
And each of these, in itself,
could, of course, be its own

35
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,070
dictionary, which means it would
be represented using the

36
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,280
curly braces.

37
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,370
So we're going to build up
everything from these two

38
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:22,720
basic data structures.

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,720
The two basic structures are
arrays and dictionaries.

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,410
Now we're going to go through
and show you each of these and

41
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,530
teach you how to write them.

42
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,710
And then we'll go one higher
level and show how they're

43
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,730
used in data representation
relative

44
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,980
to relational databases.

45
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,900
