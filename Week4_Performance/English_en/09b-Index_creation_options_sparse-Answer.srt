1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,870

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,020
And the answer is that,
this is going

3
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,790
to return no documents.

4
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:06,820
And it's going to return no
documents because the query

5
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,090
uses the index and there are no
documents with title null

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:10,940
in the index.

7
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,050
And you can test that in the
shell if you'd like to confirm

8
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,300
that is the case.

9
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,220
