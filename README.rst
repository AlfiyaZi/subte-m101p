Translation of the `MongoDB University`_ Courses.

Contributing
============

Contributing is very easy, just follow these steps:

- Fork this repository with your GitHub account.
- Create a new issue assigning yourself the translation of a lesson's files.
- Create a "lesson branch" to make changes to the caption files you have
  assigned.
- And finally, send the pull request from this new branch in your repository
  to our master branch, noting also the issue that you will close.

As you translate, it is easier to have a modern video player where can use
the subtitles, such as VLC and Dragon Player. For this only have to make sure
to download video from YouTube and specify the same name that is assigned the
subtitle.
