Contributing
============

Contributing is very easy, just follow these steps:

#. Fork this repository with your GitHub account.
#. Create a new issue assigning yourself the translation of a lesson's files.

   For instance: `#111: "Translate Week 2 | 26-getLastError"
   <https://github.com/MongoDBPeru/subte-m101p/issues/111>`_.

#. Create a "lesson branch" or "issue branch"::

   $ git checkout -b lesson-or-issue

#. Make changes to the caption files you have assigned::

   $ git commit -am "Completed translation of lesson into Spanish. Resolve #111."
   $ git push origin lesson-or-issue

#. And finally, send the pull request from this new branch in your repository
   to our master branch, noting also the issue that you will close.

   For instance: `#180: "Completed translation of 26-getLastError into Spanish"
   <https://github.com/MongoDBPeru/subte-m101p/pull/180>`_ is a pull request
   that resolve the issue `#111`_.

.. note::

   The team uses a `Kanban board in Huboard
   <http://huboard.com/MongoDBPeru/subte>`_ to track and manage assignments
   caption files, please consider it to make contributions.

   Usually, at least a team member will verify and discuss your changes before
   merging. So you may have to do more than one commit per pull request.

.. tip::

   As you translate, it is easier to have a modern video player where can use
   the subtitles, such as VLC and Dragon Player. For this only have to make
   sure to download videos from YouTube and specify the same names that is
   assigned for the subtitles.
